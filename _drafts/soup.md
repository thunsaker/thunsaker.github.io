Foursquare has survived as long as it has because of the efforts of normal people that like/love Foursquare and want to share it with the world! Those people are superusers, they are not your normal Foursquare user that likes to find new places, checkin and sometimes share things with friends. This people correct venue listsing, everything from fixing simple spelling errors to adding detailed hours of operations and filling out missing contact information. Foursquare owes them a HUGE amount of gratitude for not only spreading the word, but for literally helping build the massive location database that Foursquare is known for.
