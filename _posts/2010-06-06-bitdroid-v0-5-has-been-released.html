My second first update has been released and is ready for immediate consumption/updating. I've added a dashboard and an "action bar" after reading up on <a href="http://android-developers.blogspot.com/2010/05/twitter-for-android-closer-look-at.html">Android's Evolving UI Patterns</a> on
the Android blog. The dashboard and action bar will continue to evolve as it is developed.

    I've also added the ability to shorten a URL, wow, what would a bit.ly app be without the ability to shorten a url...you can also expand bit.ly urls.</div>

Other changes include validation on the login screen with username and api key and some bug fixes. Go grab it now and let me know what you think.
