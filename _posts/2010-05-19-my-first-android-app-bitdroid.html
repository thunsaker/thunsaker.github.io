I did it, I got all the kinks worked out, made myself a fancy icon, and put menus all over the place. &nbsp;My app has been published, look for it in the Android Market under "BitDroid" or "com.thunsaker" or scan this handy QR code:<br /><div style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_DiR5Uh09_qs/S_OhBNWxP9I/AAAAAAAAEzE/JC8bWbkVYa8/s1600/qrcode_market.png" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; display: inline !important; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="200" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_DiR5Uh09_qs/S_OhBNWxP9I/AAAAAAAAEzE/JC8bWbkVYa8/s200/qrcode_market.png" width="200" /></a></div><br />The app isn't much right now, all it lets you do is enter a username, anyone will do, and it will show you the public list of urls that have been shortened by that user. Here's my list:<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_DiR5Uh09_qs/S_OhaFc7D-I/AAAAAAAAEzI/9KIXOimKOMM/s1600/BitDroid_LinksList_v0.2.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="400" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_DiR5Uh09_qs/S_OhaFc7D-I/AAAAAAAAEzI/9KIXOimKOMM/s400/BitDroid_LinksList_v0.2.png" width="266" /></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">The application will be evolving over time, I still need to work in actual url shortening, and then verification of username with bit.ly api key. &nbsp;More work, but for right now, I'm just happy to have something in the Android Marketplace. &nbsp;Feedback is welcome, let me know if it crashes on you, I was only able to test on two devices: G1 and Droid Incredible.</div>
