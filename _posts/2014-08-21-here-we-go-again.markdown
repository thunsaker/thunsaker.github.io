Here we go again...I'm writing.

![Running](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/1931029/batman_robin_running.gif)

I stopped some time ago, I don't remember if I was bored, busy, tired or just forgot. I'm going to give this another try, I'll be writing shorter posts, so hopefully it won't be as intimidating or time consuming.


**Possible Future Posts**

- My Top Android Apps for 2014
- Redesign/Rebranding of my [first Android app][bitdroid-announcement] BitDroid to [Brevos][brevos]
- Upgrading my Android apps with Dependency Injection using Square's [Dagger][dagger] and Green Robot's [EventBus][eventbus]
- Android 4+ dev first for my [Foursquare Superuser][foursquare-superuser] app [Soup][soup].
- Thoughts on Android L/Material Design

I'm also using this fancy github-hosted Jekyll blog. I imported my blogger posts and found an awesome theme, [Hikari][hikari], to go with it all. I'm still working on the redirects from my old blog and trying to preserve my old links.
