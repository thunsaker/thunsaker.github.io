As Android has grown in popularity and the range of devices has widened, many of my friends and family have been getting Android phones. This list is supposed be a starting point for those getting a new Android phone or really wanting to get the most out of the phone they already have.  

<a href="http://www.appbrain.com/app/tweetdeck-(twitter-facebook)/com.thedeck.android.app">TweetDeck</a> [Free] - By far the quickest and easiest way to view and reply to Twitter/Facebook/Buzz updates on Android. &nbsp;The columns can be customized to display all updates or only the updates from certain services or people. &nbsp;They also have a <a href="http://tweetdeck.com/">Desktop</a> and <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/hbdpomandigafcibbmofojjchbcdagbl">Chrome App</a> version.  

<a href="http://www.appbrain.com/app/launcherpro/com.fede.launcher">LauncherPro</a> [Free] - While I appreciate the default homescreen, I can't be limited to just three icons that I can't change. LauncherPro does many things, I can switch the number of homescreens from an unwieldy 7 down to a manageable 3-5. It also gives me secondary actions for all 5 icons on the bottom of the screen, for example if I swipe up on my messaging icon it takes me to the Compose Message screen, saving me time and a few steps. &nbsp;There are many other reasons, but these are the most prominent.  

<a href="http://www.appbrain.com/app/angry-birds/com.rovio.angrybirds">Angry Birds</a> &amp;<a href="http://www.appbrain.com/app/angry-birds-seasons/com.rovio.angrybirdsseasons"> Angy Birds Seasons</a> [Free] - Best time waster ever. &nbsp;Both are free, though they include some semi-obtrusive ads. I would pay good money to go ad free.  

<a href="http://www.appbrain.com/app/dropbox/com.dropbox.android">Dropbox</a> [Free] - If you are familiar with <a href="http://www.dropbox.com/">Dropbox.com</a> you will no doubt love the Android companion app. &nbsp;Dropbox is a file syncing service that is accessible from pretty much anywhere you have an internet connection. &nbsp;You add files on the web, phone or computer and within seconds they are accessible on all devices. &nbsp;This is very useful for backing up files from your phone. &nbsp;I use it to save pictures taken with my phone in case it gets lost or stolen.  

<a href="http://www.appbrain.com/app/appbrain-app-market/com.appspot.swisscodemonkeys.apps">AppBrain</a> [Free] - While the Android Market client recently received a facelift, it still lacks a real web-based component for browsing market content. &nbsp;Google showed off the web-based market earlier this year, so expect it some time next year. &nbsp;In the meantime use AppBrain, which lets you browse apps on the web, then queue them up for install on your device. All links to apps on this page go to <a href="http://appbrain.com/">appbrain.com</a>  

<a href="http://www.appbrain.com/app/google-maps/com.google.android.apps.maps">Google Maps</a> [Free] - I could not live without Google Maps in my pocket, I would have been lost many times over. The latest update added offline support, new vector-based maps (which take up less memory) and 3D maps for most Android 2.2 devices. Overview of features at <a href="http://googlemobile.blogspot.com/2010/12/next-generation-of-mobile-maps.html">Google Mobile Blog</a>.  

<a href="http://www.appbrain.com/app/movies/net.flixster.android">Movies</a> (by Flixster) [Free] - Great for seeing what is playing at your local cinema, what is being released on DVD/Blu-Ray/Digital Download, and managing your Netflix queue. &nbsp;You can even log in with your Facebook account and upload reviews of movies to shared with your friends. &nbsp;Access to showtimes, release dates, trailers and Netflix make this a must-have for entertainment junkies. &nbsp;Check out the <a href="http://www.appbrain.com/app/imdb-movies-tv/com.imdb.mobile">IMDB</a> app if you need info on TV shows.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.appbrain.com/app/gmail/com.google.android.gm">Gmail</a> [Free] - Yet another app that is being used all day long. I almost like it as much as the full desktop web version. &nbsp;I use this to triage my mail when not at my computer, and as a scratch-pad note system since Gmail syncs drafts. &nbsp;The latest update added a refreshed compose screen with support for multiple sender addresses and easier reply options.  

<a href="http://www.appbrain.com/app/calwidget/net.eggenstein.android.calwidget">CalWidget</a> [Free] - Like Gmail, I have Google Calendar setup in a meticulous manner to help me remember things and make sure I'm not late paying my bills or wishing someone a happy birthday. The default Android calendar widget shows one event for the day, it looks pretty but isn't very useful. CalWidget lets me pick a size so I don't have to take up an entire homescreen, unless I want to. If you have an HTC, Samsung, or Motorola phone, you may already have a decent calendar widget, if not this one is well worth the download.
    
I probably missed a lot of great apps, this is just a small list that I use very often.  Let me know in the comments of your top Android apps.
